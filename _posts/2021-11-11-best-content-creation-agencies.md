Content creation agencies help manage a company's content strategy, from planning and creation to publication on the client's behalf. This article provides a list of the top five content creation agencies in the US and beyond and some of the industries they specialize in reaching.

In January of 1996, tech pioneer Bill Gates coined his famous essay, [Content Is King](https://medium.com/@HeathEvans/content-is-king-essay-by-bill-gates-1996-df74552f80d9). "The broad opportunities for most companies involve supplying information or entertainment. No company is too small to participate," he wrote candidly. "Those who succeed will propel the Internet forward as a marketplace of ideas, experiences, and products - a marketplace of content."

Although Gates could not have known how providential his statement would be, his quote remains an oft-cited indication of the power of content creation. Content was, is, and will remain the king of the online marketing world.

Today, there are quite literally dozens of content creation avenues available, from freelance work to in-house teams. One of the most highly sought-after methods is the content creation agency: a cost-effective, highly efficient team of experts specializing in generating, curating, and publishing content.

Not all content creation agencies are equal, though. Finding the best among them takes industry insight and a good sense of your goals and milestones. However, there are a couple of shortcuts that could help you make an informed decision.

Let's look at some of the best content creation agencies on the market and how they make a difference for clients worldwide. Strap in, because we're covering:

* Benefits of hiring an agency
* 5 of the best content creation agencies
* Finding the perfect content creation agency

## What Do Content Creation Agencies Do?

According to Draft.dev's founder Karl Hughes, content marketing "utilizes the [power of storytelling](https://draft.dev/learn/content-creation-agency) to raise awareness and desire, to build trust, and to drive sales." In other words, it's the process of creating content that your customers actually want to consume.

Content creation agencies specialize in the design, execution, and publication of content in many forms. Depending on the agency in question, this could mean:

* Blogs
* Videos
* Tutorials
* Websites
* Podcasts
* Images
* Infographics
* Social media posts
* Webinars
* Contests
* Reports
* Quizzes
* Ebooks

Content creation agencies are not always necessary for the creation of content. Businesses can and do build content campaigns with internal teams all the time. With a solid knowledge base, content creation, publication, and dissemination can bypass agencies entirely.

However, internal teams are not always an option for younger businesses or growing startups. If your ultimate goal is to reach a new audience, turn a profit, or raise leads over time, you may want to rely on a content creation agency. Even if you have an internal team, agencies can partner alongside your growing in-house experts to create even more focused content. What's more, you may not be prepared for the time it takes to develop a solid in-house team and need a little extra help. More on that later.

### Benefits Of Hiring An Agency

Given some time to learn your business, agencies can create high-quality, long-form content that reaches your target market.

The best content creation agencies partner alongside your business to create sustainable success:

* Diverse content teams with multiple skills, talents, and subject matter experts
* Accountability to your KPIs, team members, and long-term goals
* Work alongside your in-house experts

Content creation agencies often specialize in particular industries or business structures, with some of the most common including finance, SaaS, B2B, and eCommerce. This allows you to find the best possible fit for your business.

If you're unsure of the benefits of content creation agencies, [98% of B2B brands](https://www.walkersands.com/resources/the-future-of-b2b-content-2019/) believe that the cost of hiring a content agency is justified by its many benefits. Two of the most cited benefits include five times the lead generation and [62% less overhead](https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-marketing-strategy-guide/) compared to older marketing formats. 

Perhaps the most significant benefit of content creation agencies is lightning-fast speed. Unlike in-house teams, which could [take time to ramp up](https://www.workamajig.com/blog/in-house-agency-guide), content creation agencies can get started as soon as you sign on the dotted line. It's a win-win for everyone!
