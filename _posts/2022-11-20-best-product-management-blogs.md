In project management, teams use specific skills, processes, tools, and methods to successfully steer a project from beginning to completion. The main objective is to deliver a high-quality product to the end user while staying within time and budget constraints.

The managers who lead these projects must be aware of the latest techniques, tools, and data relevant to their product so that they're better equipped to meet users' expectations and generate revenue for their organization. A good way to stay informed is to consult blogs maintained by project management experts. It can be challenging, though, to comb through the many blogs out there to find the best sources.

Instead, check this roundup of twenty-three blogs to follow for project management insights. The blogs included are scored based on writing quality, consistency, longevity, technical depth, and usefulness.
