After days and months of toiling, you finally finish creating your game-changing product that will shake the developer world. You invest a large amount of resources in marketing and find some customers. But surprisingly, instead of seeing your product getting praise from critics all around, you notice that developers are leaving poor reviews and expressing frustrations. They say that your product is "too complicated" and "difficult to understand."

This is a very common story and is one of the big reasons you should invest in writing good documentation for your product. The documentation is the relationship manager between your product and the developers. Good documentation makes the life of developers easy by explaining the features of your product, whereas bad documentation can frustrate and drive away the developers, even if your product is superb and does a fantastic job! Good documentation also lifts the burden from your support team because if developers can get answers to their questions from the documentation, they won't need to bother the support team with their issues. Believe me, no developer likes filling out a form and waiting multiple days for an answer from the support team when they can get their answers from the documentation.

The [other article](https://draft.dev/learn/technical-documentation-what-it-is-and-how-to-do-it-well) explained what makes documentation good. In this article, you'll see some real-life examples of good documentation. You can take inspiration from these amazing documentation examples and apply the learnings the next time you create documentation.

## 12 Best Documentation Examples

Before you jump into the list, let's take a moment to understand the parameters these entries have been judged on:

* **Depth of documentation:** Documentation must be in-depth. This means it must cover all features and all the different ways to use the tool, including installation, setup, configuration, and advanced usage. Bonus points if a quick-start guide is provided that helps developers get started with the product quickly.
* **Examples:** The documentation must have enough examples, and the examples should cover as many use cases as possible. The examples should be complete and understandable to someone who has never used the tool before. Bonus points if the examples are interactive and can be run directly from the docs.
* **UI/UX:** Having detailed documentation is not enough if the UI/UX is bad. The UI should be clean and easy to use. It doesn't have to be super flashy, but it needs to strike a balance between looks and materials. The UX should also be aimed at making the lives of developers easy. For example, in some documentation, if an API uses an API key and you're logged in, it automatically populates the API key by taking it from your account.
* **Search and navigation:** It doesn't matter how detailed the docs are if finding things becomes as hard as finding a needle in a haystack. A search feature is a must in any documentation, and the search experience should be good. Features such as autocomplete, autosuggestion, and fuzzy searching are always appreciated. Navigating the docs is also another closely related issue. Navigating the docs must be easy, with enough internal and external links, and the docs should be structured in a way that makes sense.

Now, without further ado, let's get to the list.

> **Note:** This is not an exhaustive list by any means. This list is purely opinion-based, and you might find a tool that you feel has better documentation than any tool in this list. Remember that the goal of this article is to inspire you, not to judge tools based on their documentation.

### Stripe

[Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/) is revered by developers as having one of the best documentation. The documentation home page is designed neatly with tabs at the top that link to the documentation for each product, such as **Payments**, **Developer tools**, and **No-code**.

![Docker search widget](https://i.imgur.com/JMpG7Yn.png)

When it comes to depth, it's hard to beat the Docker documentation. A simple example is the installation guide for Docker Engine. Not only does Docker provide guides for different operating systems and platforms, but it also provides you with useful tips like post-installation steps and troubleshooting guides:

![The installation guide](https://i.imgur.com/QhXqVWW.png)

Docker provides thorough examples and explanations for all its features, including related environment variables, configuration files, and experimental features. The **[Reference documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/)** section is a goldmine for discovering every single property of the Docker CLI, Dockerfile, Compose file, and API. Finally, the **[FAQ](https://docs.docker.com/faq/)** section saves developers much time as it already answers common questions.

In conclusion, the Docker documentation is an example of an all-around solid documentation. A clean UI/UX, complete examples, and a nice FAQ section shine as its plus points.

### Twilio

[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs) is a popular service that provides communication tools for making and receiving phone calls, texts, emails, and much more. The Twilio documentation clearly shows the amount of effort put into the tool to make it accessible to every developer. The documentation boasts a clear and modern design, with the home page showcasing different products. The documentation is offered in three languages: English, German, and Spanish:

![Twilio documentation home page](https://i.imgur.com/q9ZiAx1.png)

Just like Docker, Twilio also uses Algolia to implement the search functionality. So you can rest assured you will find what you are looking for!

The Vue documentation also uses Algolia to implement searching. Needless to say, it provides a solid site-wide searching experience with autosuggestions and fuzzy searching.

Overall, the Vue documentation does a good job of covering all the grounds and showing you the full power of Vue through an interactive playground.

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. [Next.js](https://pagepro.co/blog/what-is-nextjs/) has seen a boom in popularity, and there's no surprise that it boasts great documentation. The Next.js documentation has a sleek, modern UI that greets you with a nice introduction that sets the stage for what to expect:

![Next.js documentation home page](https://i.imgur.com/CGhLsCu.png)

The docs provide a thorough tour of the features of Next.js, including routing, rendering, caching, components, and functions. You can choose whether you want to use the [Pages Router or App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router):

![The topics covered](https://i.imgur.com/leiNbvQ.png)

A fast and snappy search widget is provided, which can also be activated by pressing **CTRL + K**. You get a documentation-wide search with the option to switch between the Pages Router or the App Router:

### Google Cloud

Let's face it, [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/docs/) is a behemoth. With a product of that size, you'd expect the documents to be complicated. But Google has done a commendable job of keeping it organized. The home page immediately points toward the quick-start guides, tutorials, and code samples for those who are just testing the waters with Google Cloud:

![Google Cloud documentation home page](https://i.imgur.com/Hvcl4lw.png)

For seasoned veterans, scrolling down reveals the list of documentation of every single one of the hundreds of products available in Google Cloud:

![The list of products](https://i.imgur.com/6mldzio.png)

Each product showcases a collection of training materials and tutorials, use cases, code samples, and even videos:

![A typical product page](https://i.imgur.com/fr5gPE7.png)

The tutorials are clear, are in-depth, and link to appropriate pages in the console. With one press of a button, you are taken to where you need to be to follow along with the tutorial:

![The tutorials](https://i.imgur.com/zJLOYxI.png)

For codes and commands, you get the option to edit variables inline, which then replaces all occurrences of the variable in the rest of the tutorial, making it easy for you to copy-paste the code:

![The code snippets](https://i.imgur.com/aSErFbR.png)

When it comes to search, it's a no-brainer that Google dominates that field. This documentation is also no different. Google's powerful search engine can fetch you hundreds of results in milliseconds:

![Google Cloud search widget](https://i.imgur.com/vVRrOgp.png)

However, Google takes its documentation one step further by incorporating [role-based learning](https://cloud.google.com/learn?hl=en), a [training hub](https://cloud.google.com/learn/training?hl=en), and [certifications](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification?hl=en). This means that if you want to learn Google Cloud, their documentation is literally the best place for that.

The Google Cloud Services stand out from the rest by incorporating training programs and guides. It's pretty hard to beat Google Cloud Services in terms of the resources provided.

### Amazon Web Services

Just like Google Cloud, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation-overview/) is a giant in the cloud computing landscape. And just like Google Cloud, AWS also hosts hundreds of products, so you can expect the documentation to also be gigantic. Unfortunately, the AWS documentation is organized very confusingly, especially if someone has never used AWS before. If you go to the [AWS home page](https://aws.amazon.com) and click on the **Documentation** tab, you'll be taken to a page that seems daunting because it just has links to all the products and nothing else:

![AWS documentation home page](https://i.imgur.com/pZBEjlQ.png)

If you click on any of the links, you'll realize that it's not the full documentation but rather just an overview of that product:

![Overview of a product](https://i.imgur.com/JX8B3DB.png)

That's because the **Documentation** page is just a collection of overviews of different products. To find the actual documentation of a product, you need to find it from the **Products** menu and click on it to go to the product's home page:

![The product home page](https://i.imgur.com/FzFvnsm.png)

From there, you can click on **Resources** and then on **Documentation** to find the documentation:

![The product documentation](https://i.imgur.com/8yihrnn.png)

However, where AWS lacks in user experience, it makes up for in terms of depth and usefulness. After all the work you did to find the documentation for a product, you'll be rewarded because it'll be all you need. Each product page has easy-to-understand overviews with diagrams, getting-started guides, use cases, and often, introductory videos.

The documentation is thorough, covering all possible ground, starting from setup and prerequisites, all the way up to advanced features, best practices, tutorials, and code examples:

![A typical guide](https://i.imgur.com/np9FElP.png)

The code examples provide options to choose your favorite language or framework, and you also get a mega [repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main) of all code examples used in the documentation:

![The code snippets](https://i.imgur.com/9Z5crNT.png)

As for search capabilities, AWS offers a super powerful search engine that returns results from the documentation across all their products, blogs, and resources, as long as you search from the **[Overview](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation-overview/)** page:

![The search widget](https://i.imgur.com/nbWqsv5.png)

If you search from within an individual product's documentation, by default, it'll be scoped to that product only, but you can simply remove the filter to trigger a full documentation search:

![Site-wide search](https://i.imgur.com/4uVSNv8.png)

AWS offers the ability to download each product's documentation as a PDF so that you can store an offline copy or read it from your own devices.

Overall, AWS loses a few points on the UI/UX front but scores solid points for the volume and depth of the guides.

### Heroku

[Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) is a cloud platform as a service that offers hosting applications written in a wide range of languages, such as Ruby, Node.js, Scala, and Go. The Heroku documentation home page starts with a prompt to select your programming language, along with links to some important language-agnostic features, such as the Heroku CLI, Heroku CI, and logging:

![Heroku documentation home page](https://i.imgur.com/JvRHbC2.png)

For each language, they offer a quick-start guide that starts from the setup and takes you to the full-fledged app deployment on Heroku:

![The quick-start guide](https://i.imgur.com/vAlYxCe.png)

Each quick-start guide has an accompanying sample application that you can clone from GitHub:

![Sample application](https://i.imgur.com/AjzZsdw.png)

You can log into Heroku and save your progress in the quick start. This means you don't need to finish the quick start in one go, and you can learn at your own pace.

Apart from quick-start guides, Heroku has in-depth documentation on other features, such as the CLI tool, continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), database, monitoring, add-ons, and security and billing.

The search feature of the Heroku documentation is very good. It doesn't have autocomplete or autosuggestion, but it can search through the documentation, marketplace, blog, and the whole of the Heroku website:

![Heroku search widget](https://i.imgur.com/AXOT7vg.png)

For non-English-speaking developers, Heroku docs are also available in Japanese.

The Heroku documentation shows how you can create good documentation with a minimal and clean UI while still delivering enough content. Although it doesn't have an interactive playground like Vue, it is in no way less resourceful.

### Vercel

If you were impressed by the Next.js documentation, wait till you see the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) documentation. Since Vercel is the company behind Next.js, it's no surprise their documentation feels very similar to the Next.js documentation in terms of UI and aesthetics. At first glance, they both use a similar design and UI elements, like cards, buttons, and a sidebar:

![Vercel documentation home page](https://i.imgur.com/90CRlgN.png)

Vercel provides a **[Get started with Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel)** guide that gives you an overview of the process that you need to follow to deploy your app on Vercel. Vercel provides framework-specific documentation, such as [Next.js](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs), [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit), and [Remix](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/remix). You can deploy an app straight from the documentation by clicking on the **Deploy** buttons, or you can choose a template:

![Vercel **Deploy** button](https://i.imgur.com/M1Nv9xu.png)

The code snippets show an option to switch between JavaScript and TypeScript. The code snippets also have line highlighting, which makes it easy to draw attention to particular lines of code. Each snippet is accompanied by a file name, line numbers, and a **Copy** button to make your life easier:

![The code snippets](https://i.imgur.com/jg7tBNn.png)

Each page also has a **More Resources** section so that you can follow up on what you learned by using it in a real-life scenario:

![More resources](https://i.imgur.com/vDq3vqT.png)

Finally, searching in the Vercel documentation is similar to Next.js, except you get an option to search within the Vercel docs, the Next.js docs, the [Turborepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs), or through everything:

![Vercel search widget](https://i.imgur.com/IhXhB2O.png)

The Vercel documentation, just like Next.js, has a great combination of good UI and content that delivers immense value to the developer.

### Netlify

While on the topic of cloud platform-as-a-service providers, don't ignore [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/). Netlify is used by big companies, such as Google, Twilio, and Peloton, to deploy their web infrastructure. The Netlify documentation greets you with a minimal and sleek modern design, with links to Netlify products and a sidebar menu:

![Netlify documentation home page](https://i.imgur.com/XHVulSk.png)

The docs cover a wide range of topics, starting from a quick-start guide to advanced features, such as the Netlify CLI. The guides are accompanied by code snippets and video tutorials wherever possible:

![The code snippets](https://i.imgur.com/2iVYO6a.png)

The guides do a great job of explaining the topics in detail, and if you still feel like you're stuck, you can send them feedback about the docs directly from the page:

![The feedback form](https://i.imgur.com/4J6OLc5.png)

The search widget of the Netlify documentation does a great job of finding the relevant information quickly and accurately. The search bar supports autosuggestion and fuzzy searching:

![Netlify search widget](https://i.imgur.com/K0mvypf.png)

However, one area where Netlify excels is the **[Ask Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/get-help/ask-netlify/)** feature. It's an integrated AI chatbot that you can ask questions, and it'll find you the answers based on the product documentation, support forums, blogs, CLI documentation, and API documentation.

Netlify goes one step further by incorporating an AI chatbot into the documentation. With the advent of AI, incorporating it is a big step toward an excellent user experience. However, even without the AI chatbot, Netlify documentation holds great value for any developer with its tutorials, guides, and examples.

### Tailscale

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/start) is a VPN service that lets you access your devices and services from anywhere in the world. Tailscale boasts simple but thorough documentation. It doesn't have the super modern design that some of the other entries in this list have, but it makes up for that with the content:

![Tailscale documentation home page](https://i.imgur.com/wI51x6E.png)

The Tailscale documentation covers a wide range of topics and explains all its bells and whistles. The guides are super thorough, with lucid explanations, along with screenshots and internal links:

![The topics covered](https://i.imgur.com/qaqSwnE.png)

Where needed, code snippets are provided. The snippets lack line numbers, but they have syntax highlighting, and comments are used to explain different parts:

![Code snippets](https://i.imgur.com/env1K4n.png)

The search widget supports autosuggestion, and it can show you results quickly. However, it doesn't support fuzzy searching:

![Tailscale search widget](https://i.imgur.com/JyGJQEf.png)

Tailscale does a fantastic job of packing a punch within a clean and minimal UI. The documentation is solid, explains all features, and goes into in-depth explanations.
