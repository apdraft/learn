One challenge that every startup faces is attracting and engaging users. Whether you sell a software tool or a service, you need a way to quickly tell visitors about it and hook them into trying it. That’s where a landing page comes in.

A good landing page helps visitors quickly determine whether or not your offering is right for them, and if it is, the landing page should direct them to take an action. Depending on what it is you’re promoting, your landing page might ask for an email address, encourage a file download, or direct users to add something to their cart.

Either way, you don’t have to spend weeks coding your landing page from scratch. In fact, even if you have developers on your team, I would encourage you to use  landing page tools rather than try to build your own.
