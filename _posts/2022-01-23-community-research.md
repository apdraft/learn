In 2021, I gave a short talk at DevRelCon about [the different methods for coming up with content ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ7Y_2eH2Io) that resonate with software developers. We've now worked with over 70 developer tools companies at [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev), so we've been able to glean a lot of information about what works and what doesn't in [developer marketing](https://draft.dev/learn/developer-marketing).

Last year, we started offering [keyword research as an add-on service](https://draft.dev/learn/topic-clusters) to help our clients come up with ideas for technical content, and this year, I'm excited to launch our community research service. By looking into existing developer conversations, we can help you come up with content ideas that are more likely to resonate with your target audience.

## What is Community Research?

Once you kick off an engagement for community research, one of our developer marketing professionals will meet with you to discuss your product, content goals, and existing content efforts. From there, we'll dive into developer communities like Reddit, Hacker News, and various Slack groups to come up with interesting ideas for content that will resonate with your audience.

Your team can pick their favorite topics from our list or help refine the topics we send based on your own market research and preferences.

I outlined the process briefly in my talk at DevRelCon:

## Next Steps

While we don't offer end-to-end content marketing strategy, we are happy to help you come up with topics that will resonate with software developers. Keyword or community research can help you fill your blog's backlog with great ideas for either your team or ours to write about.
