In 2021, I gave a short talk at DevRelCon about [the different methods for coming up with content ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ7Y_2eH2Io) that resonate with software developers. We've now worked with over 70 developer tools companies at [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev), so we've been able to glean a lot of information about what works and what doesn't in [developer marketing](https://draft.dev/learn/developer-marketing).

Last year, we added topic ideation and [keyword research](https://draft.dev/learn/topic-clusters) to our service offering to help our clients develop technical content ideas. This year, I’m excited to add community research to our topic ideation process. By looking into existing developer conversations, we can help you develop content ideas that are more likely to resonate with your target audience.

## What is Community Research?

Once you kick off an engagement with Draft.dev, one of our developer marketing professionals will meet with you to discuss your product, content goals, and existing content efforts. From there, we’ll dive into developer communities like Reddit, Hacker News, and various Slack groups to develop interesting topics and ideas for content that will resonate with your audience.

Your team can pick their favorite topics from our list or help refine the proposed topics based on your market research and preferences.

I outlined the process briefly in my talk at DevRelCon:
