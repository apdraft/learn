Podcasts have emerged as a powerful medium for reaching a technical audience. The number of developer podcasts have proliferated in recent years and in fact, [the global podcasting market is expected to grow from USD 21.4 billion in 2022 to USD 133.9 billion in 2032](https://market.us/report/podcasting-market/#:~:text=Report%20Overview,register%20a%20CAGR%20of%2027.8%25.). Getting booked as a guest or sponsor on these shows gets you direct access to your target customers’ ears.

At Draft.dev, we're well aware of the value of reaching tech audiences through podcasts. Our clients often seek our guidance on which programming podcasts offer the most suitable opportunities for guest appearances, sponsorships, and advertising. That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the best software engineering podcasts.

These podcasts run the gamut of technical topics. Many of these programming podcasts have sponsorship and guest spots open, so if you’re trying to reach a technical audience, it’s worth reaching out. Finally, this list will continue to grow as we find new episodes, so check back occasionally if you don’t immediately find what you need.
