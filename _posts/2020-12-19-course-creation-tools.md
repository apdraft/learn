If your product requires specialized knowledge or if you're trying to position yourself as a thought leader, creating an online course could be a great marketing strategy. Online courses can [even be businesses in their own right](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/make-money/how-to-create-online-courses/). Many people are more comfortable taking courses online so they don't have to leave home, but if you're trying to create one, where do you start?

## How to Create an Online Course
I worked in education technology for many years before I started [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev), so while I'm not an expert course creator, I have supported a number of others in building online education solutions. I won't go into details in this post, but the abbreviated process typically goes something like this:

1. Pick your topic.
2. Outline the course and modules.
3. Write the text content for your course (could be a script if you're doing videos)
4. Record the content.
5. Publish the content.
6. Distribute the content.

A lot of course creators focus on the first four points and forget that **they ultimately need a way to collect payments and distribute their courses too.**

## Online Course Creation Platforms
This list is meant to provide a jumping-off point. I've tried to highlight many of the best course creation platforms available and give you a little bit of information about each one. Some are free and open-source, while others are paid and full of time-saving features.
