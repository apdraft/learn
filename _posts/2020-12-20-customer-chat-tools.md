If you want to engage your customers at the moment they're considering buying your product or signing up for your service, there's no better way than live chat. You're probably familiar with Intercom or Autopilot because they've become so ubiquitous now, but there are _many_ other options out there.

## Should You Use Live Chat?
To be honest, live chat widgets aren't for everyone. You'll notice that I don't have one on the [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev) website because as a [content creation agency](https://draft.dev/learn/content-creation-agency) it's rarely critical that we address customers' concerns immediately.

That said, software-as-a-service vendors should consider adding live chat. Users expect a seamless, self-service experience, so being able to respond immediately is really important.

Many live chat widgets also allow you to proactively reach out to customers based on their past interactions with your site. This is really helpful if you know it takes several touch-points to close the deal with your target market.

The downside to live chat is that it gives customers the impression that you're available all the time. When you don't respond quickly, you might discourage potential buyers, so it's important to have someone monitoring your live chat widget frequently.
