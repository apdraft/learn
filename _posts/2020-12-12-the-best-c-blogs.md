C# is a language loved by its users for being versatile, productive, and keeping up with the current problems programmers need to solve. For example, maintainers have added functional programming concepts to the primarily imperative C# language, adding the powerful query-functionality in LINQ, and smoother handling of asynchronous programming with the `async`/`await`-syntax.

The unification of all versions of .NET into .NET 5 has given C# and .NET future-safety, no matter which platform you use to develop or which platform you develop for: desktop, web, cloud, mobile, or other.

Whether you're getting into C# with the launch of .NET 5 or if you're a long-time C# developer, there are a lot of great blogs out there. Based on writing quality, consistency, longevity, technical depth, and usefulness, I've put together **this comprehensive list of the 20 best C# blogs publishing today**.

Sometimes, I'm unsure if you're allowed to use .NET if you're not reading Scott Hanselman's blog. There might be something in EULA about that. 😉

Jokes aside, Hanselman has been blogging about C# and .NET from the very start and has inspired many people with the content on his blog, his conference-talks, his podcast, his YouTube-channel, and more. He mixes high-level articles with some technical deep-dives, and his posts seem to be driven by his passion for learning and solving problems.

## Final Words

While researching this post, I went through every single account I subscribe to on Twitter to pick out the best blogs from the best people I've been following for many years - often over a decade. I was surprised to recognize so many names I had associated with quality content and learned so much from, but what surprised me even more was how many of these people had stopped blogging or switched focus away from C# and .NET.

Scott Guthrie is probably a perfect example. He used to be one of the top bloggers within our field before he was promoted to the fancy title of *Executive Vice President* at Microsoft, where the blog no longer seemed to be a priority. So subscribe to these blogs while you can. You never know when things will change.
