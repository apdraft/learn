Python is one of [the most popular programming languages](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html), so I went on a journey to find the best Python blogs being maintained today. Each of these sites demonstrate technical expertise, is relatively easy to comprehend, publishes content consistently, and has stood the test of time.

During this process, I used the same approach for analyzing and comparing common qualities (or deficiencies) in each blog. 

I looked at the depth of each blog’s technical content and the usefulness of that content. I read a few posts from start to finish to get a sense of the writing quality and comprehensibility. I looked at how consistently each blog publishes new content, and I did some digging to learn how long each site has been around.

Here are the top 30 Python blogs I found:

1. **[effbot](http://effbot.org/)**

Effbot is a minimalist early 2000s blog that hosts hundreds of articles on Python and related technologies. You’ll be glad you discovered this expansive resource consisting of overviews, tutorials, repositories, and articles covering all proficiency levels and unique user applications. To boot, effbot’s articles offer comprehensive details and cogent explanations of advanced technical problems and strategies. While the content is mostly technical, both summaries and examples alike are clean and organized.

2. **[r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)** \
_[RSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python.rss)_

Reddit is a massive crowd-sourced message board with a ‘subreddit’ specifically dedicated to Python, among other programming languages. “r/Python,” est. 2008, is composed of a large community of members (>500K) with varying degrees of proficiency who share dozens of questions, solutions, and ideas everyday. As is the case with some message boards, there are no sub-categories or _sub_-sub reddits, so all posts are centralized in one location. Writing is often clear and high quality, depending on the writer; however, all posts are subjective and contributed solely by other reddit users, so readability, clarity, and even language fluency does not always meet expectations.

_[RSS](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/rss.xml), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nedbat)_

Ned Batchelder is the personal blog of veteran Python developer Ned Batchelder, which is one of the original and oldest active Python blogs from the early 2000s. There's plenty of content dating back nearly 20 years; some topics being detailed breakdowns, others simple one paragraph tips. Ned keeps his content simple with no frills. Blog posts are clear enough to get the point across while sacrificing some elegance. The only improvement I can recommend would be more frequent posts; you’d be lucky to get one per month. Fortunately, there’s a huge backlog of posts to study up on, and it comes directly from the mind of a programmer who's experimented with and written Python longer than most.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">RSS</span>_

STX Next is a European software development company’s brand name programming blog. Developers may be disappointed to find a large portion of the articles are generic 'How to''s or 'Average Salaries,’ with company promotions dispersed within. While many of the articles are not technical, the ones that are seem penned by software developers and show a strong technical knowledge of Python. Each post boasts an excellent command of language, grammar, and an abundance of supporting links and references.

_[RSS](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/feed/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pycharm)_

PyCharm is the blog arm of JetBrains’ integrated development environment for Python programming. Whether it’s a product update, article, tutorial, webinar, or interview, PyCharm has consistently published a handful of new posts each month for years. While there are quite a bit of company promotions and sales plugs, there is an abundance of insightful information. Even outright sales pitches have references to Python fundamentals, user guides, and an overview of programming concepts necessary to use the product. Because most posts are primarily video/audio recordings or short-form text, there isn’t much writing to be evaluated. Still, what’s there has no glaring marks or inaccuracies, and supporting links are plentiful.

**[SkillSoft](https://www.skillsoft.com/blog?search=python)** \
_[Twitter](https://twitter.com/skillsoft)_

SkillSoft is an educational software company that produces learning management systems and content. Python-related topics on the blog only extend a few years back. However, the company has been around since the late ‘90s and you can find more relevant programming content closer to then. Even so, you shouldn’t expect a new post with any sort of regularity.

As a blog from an established tech company, it’s not surprising that the writing quality is excellent and pushes relatively little company promotion. From a technical standpoint, posts offer valuable content with extensive detail. While SkillSoft doesn’t publish quite as much content as other blogs, the articles they do have are modern, insightful, and actionable.
