I’m not a designer, and I’ve never been great at coming up with branding or logos. That said, a company with a distinct and creative logo will always look more reputable than one without.

## How Much Should You Invest in a Logo?

While you’ll probably want to invest in custom design once you raise funding, many early-stage startups would do better to save their cash and use one of the low-cost services here. Every company's brand is different. If high-quality design is a cornerstone of your image, you might invest more in your logo earlier than other competitors.
