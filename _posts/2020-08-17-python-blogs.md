Python is one of [the most popular programming languages](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) in use today, so I went on a journey to find the best Python blogs on the internet. Each of these sites demonstrates technical expertise, is relatively easy to comprehend, publishes content consistently, and has stood the test of time.

During this process, I used the same approach for analyzing and comparing common qualities (or deficiencies) in each of the Python programming blogs.

I looked at the depth of each blog’s [technical content](https://draft.dev/learn/technical-content) and the usefulness of that content. I read a few posts from start to finish to get a sense of the writing quality and comprehensibility. I looked at how consistently the python bloggers publish new content, and I did some digging to learn how long each site has been around.

Here are the top 29 Python blogs I found:

### 1. [effbot](http://effbot.org/)

*[RSS](http://effbot.org/zone/rss.xml)*

![effbot.org blog](https://i.imgur.com/FK1a7lG.png)

Effbot is a minimalist early 2000s blog that hosts hundreds of articles on Python and related technologies. You’ll be glad you discovered this expansive resource consisting of overviews, repositories, articles, and some of the best python tutorials covering all proficiency levels and unique user applications. Effbot’s articles offer comprehensive details and cogent explanations of advanced technical problems and strategies. While the content is mostly technical, both summaries and examples alike are clean and organized.

*[RSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python.rss)*

![Reddit r/Python](https://i.imgur.com/SkZRdFD.png)

Reddit is a massive crowd-sourced message board with a ‘subreddit’ specifically dedicated to Python, among other programming languages. “r/Python,” est. 2008, is probably one of the best programming subreddits you can find on the topic of Python. It’s composed of a large community of members (>500K) with varying degrees of proficiency who share dozens of questions, solutions, and ideas every day. As is the case with some message boards, there are no sub-categories or sub-subreddits, so all posts are centralized in one location. Writing is often clear and high quality, depending on the writer; however, all posts are subjective and contributed solely by other Reddit users, so readability, clarity, and even language fluency does not always meet expectations.

Yasoob, the blog’s sole writer since 2013, showcases a strong technical grasp of the whats, wheres, whens, whys, and hows to walk the reader through complex concepts with clarity and detail. Its usefulness is hamstrung by periods of sporadic posting, followed by 2-3 months of silence. Like many Python blogspots, the articles are informative and packed with data and supporting links. However, it also reads like many programming blogs: substance over aesthetics.

* Writing Quality - 3

SkillSoft is an educational software company that produces learning management systems and content. Python-related topics on the blog only extend a few years back. However, the company has been around since the late '90s, and you can find more relevant programming content closer to then. Even so, you shouldn't expect a new post with any sort of regularity.

As a blog from an established tech company, it's not surprising that the writing quality is excellent and pushes relatively little company promotion. From a technical standpoint, posts offer valuable content with extensive detail. While SkillSoft doesn't publish quite as much content as other blogs, the articles they do have are modern, insightful, and actionable.
