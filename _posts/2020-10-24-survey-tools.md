Collecting surveys from your customers is one of the best ways to gauge how and why they’re interested in your product. Sometimes you may be surprised by what you learn, but more often, surveys are a great way to identify your strongest advocates and highlight their happiness. You can also [use the responses to create new content](https://draft.dev/learn/low-cost-marketing-ideas).

While you can bring in your development team to build forms that capture customer responses, it’s usually much faster to use an off-the-shelf product. Below I’ve collected some of my favorite options.

### Paid Survey and Form Creation Tools

Let’s take a look at paid platforms for the best survey tools 2022.

**[Block Survey](https://blocksurvey.io/)** ($7) - Secure online forms and surveys. Collect data with guaranteed end–to–end encryption and privacy.

**[Google Survey Tools](https://www.google.com/analytics/surveys/)** ($0.1) - If you want to poll the general public, Google Survey Tools let you start as low as 10 cents per response.

**[IdeaCheck](http://www.ideacheck.io/)** ($49) - Helps you validate your ideas and will even find respondents for your survey.

[Pabbly](https://www.pabbly.com/form-builder/) ($10) - While paid, Pabbly doesn’t lock you out of features, so it can actually end up being much cheaper than some other options.

[SoGoSurvey](https://www.sogosurvey.com/) ($25) - Collect responses from employees and customers and then integrate with their enterprise APIs.

**[SurveyKiwi](https://surveykiwi.com/)** ($9) **\-** The cool thing about SurveyKiwi is that you can share surveys over SMS and WhatsApp, allowing you to reach customers who aren’t necessarily on a web browser.

## The Best Free Survey Tools 2022

You don’t always have to pay to get what you need, especially as a small-scale startup. Here are some of the best free survey tools for 2022.

[Picklelist](http://pickle.monkeytest.it/) ($0) - Great for conducting quick polls and giving your audience a look at the results.

[Lime Survey](https://www.limesurvey.org/) ($0) - Free and open source or you can pay for a hosted version.

[Hotjar Polls](https://www.hotjar.com/tour/#polls) ($0) - In addition to visualizing how people use your site, Hotjar lets you create embedded surveys to track what users think about your offering.

[Formspree](https://formspree.io/) ($0) - This has quickly become my favorite way to handle contact forms, but you can also use it to embed a form on any static website. The responses are emailed to you as they come in, and it’s free.

[Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) ($0) - Google Forms is simple, free, and it integrates into Google Sheets, allowing you to capture data right where you can use it. (And if you like Google Forms, but want to try some similar options, [check these out](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/google-forms-alternatives))

[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) ($0) - Capture real voices and opinions and make sense of them at scale.

[SurveySparrow](https://surveysparrow.com/) ($0) - Offers forms, chat-based surveys and much more. Works especially well for capturing NPS (Net Promoter Score) results.

[StaticKit](https://statickit.com/) ($0) - Great for integrating with static sites like Jekyll and Gatsby.

[Twitter Polls](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2015/introducing-twitter-polls.html) ($0) - If you have a significant Twitter following, these are a great way to get responses to your questions. You can also sponsor them to get even more responses.

[Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) ($0) - Makes really good looking and fun forms that integrate well with other services.

[Wufoo](https://www.wufoo.com/gallery/templates/surveys/) ($0) - Wufoo is one of my favorite embeddable forms because you can also handle integrations with services like Mailchimp, Google Sheets, and Stripe. This makes your forms really dynamic.

**[CognitoForms](https://www.cognitoforms.com/)** ($0) - With a generous free tier and customizable styling, CognitoForms gives you a lot of options for collecting data from customers.
