It’s really hard to justify paying for stock images on your blog when your startup is just getting off the ground.

While large companies may justify an in-house designer, custom photography, or very specific high-quality photos from paid sites, it's hard to spend that kind of money when you're just starting out. That said, you can probably make it a lot further than you think with one of the free options for stock photos I've listed here.

## The Importance of Having Images in Your Blog Posts

But first, why should you have images in your blog posts at all? Isn't the focus primarily on the writing?

Yes, you should spend most of your time writing great content for your blog and [promoting that content](https://draft.dev/learn/promotion), but images are important too. For example:

- They help break up long spans of text and give readers a break.
- They are great for SEO (especially if they're unique).
- Stock images can illustrate or summarize your point.

Unfortunately, stock images can be bland and expensive. In this post, I've collected some of my favorite sources of free stock imagery. These sites are great for startups that want to add high-quality images to their blog posts but don't have a huge budget to do so.

## How I Create Unique Images for My Blog
As an example of how you can use some of the tools below, I [created this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDBWJ74Fqnc) showing how I create unique lead images for my blog. Unsplash and Bannersnack are free, so in just five minutes, you can make eye-catching, original images that make your blog posts stand out on social media!

This workflow works for me, but Unsplash and Bannersnack aren't the only resources around.
