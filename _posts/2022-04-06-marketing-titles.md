Marketing is one of the fastest growing fields of the decade. Recent BLS data suggests there are more than [316,000 marketing roles](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/advertising-promotions-and-marketing-managers.htm) available in the United States, with more than 31,000 new opportunities projected to be added by 2030. And that’s not all: a [10% average growth rate](https://www.topmanagementdegrees.com/what-is-the-job-outlook-for-the-marketing-field/) puts the marketing field well ahead of adjacent industries, and is only expected to rise as new frontiers and platforms become available.

It’s clear that marketing roles are extremely significant, both for jobseekers and employers alike. Today, it takes dozens of different skill sets and positions to make the industry go ‘round, from heads of content to CMOs to the multifaceted product marketer. Marketing titles hold an enormous amount of significance, and understanding how and why they apply to your industry could make or break your future strategy.

Let’s explore the various types of marketing job titles and roles, particularly as they appear in common practice. This includes a breakdown of jobs by type and level of influence, as well as other potential resources for staying up-to-date with the job market.

## Marketing Job Titles

There are quite literally thousands of marketing titles in use today, ranging from internal colloquialisms to traditional terminology. Sure, there’s more to a name than meets the eye, but when comparing one job title against hundreds of similar sounding roles, it can be hard to discern an actual definition.

Clarity is key to success, and in the world of modern job descriptions, it matters more than ever. Let’s explore some of the most common [marketing job titles](​​https://draft.dev/learn/marketing-titles/) in the field today, including their universal meaning and function in the average department.

### Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)

Often referred to as a CMO or a C-level marketer, the chief marketing officer leads all other marketing personnel. These professionals work alongside other executives at the top of the ladder, including CEOs, CFOs, and COOs. CMOs generally have years (if not decades) of industry experience and have proved their prowess in the marketing field with years of results. 

CMOs are in charge of several different tasks, all of which are dependent on the company in question. Startups may have their CMO leading most or all daily marketing tasks, while established companies may delegate quarterly reporting tasks or project management functions.

### Head Of Marketing

Just below the CMO, the [Head Of Marketing](https://draft.dev/learn/what-is-a-head-of-marketing) is a focal point for all elements of the creating marketing process. These professionals hold the line of communication by helping advertisers, content creators, and product specialists effectively communicate upcoming projects.

You might find a Head of Marketing acting in a CMO role at smaller companies, or working as a department head for larger teams. In either case, the job duties are clear: to create the building blocks of success by delegating work among teams.

### Marketing Manager

The Marketing Manager translates high-level strategy into specific steps for the rest of the marketing team. These experts usually specialize in one or two fields within certain areas of the marketing department. For example, some managers may be in charge of content production, while others curate product positioning teams.

You might find a marketing manager performing a middle management role, toeing the line on:

* Translating new strategies
* Tracking campaign effectiveness
* Developing key insights

### Head Of Content

If your company manages a high volume of content, chances are you will need a [Head Of Content](https://draft.dev/learn/what-is-a-head-of-content) to bring it all together. Content Leads supervise the creation of content in all forms and act as the final layer of quality control for blogs, videos, and the general public.

A head of content may also be in charge of strategy creation and trend research, helping to direct the actions of content creators and the content marketing manager.

### Content Marketing Manager

Similar to the marketing manager, the Content Marketing Manager manages daily tasks for content creators, supervisors, and SEO professionals. Most firms expect this role to have strong on-the-ground responsibilities, including project updates and work supervision. 

Depending on the company in question, content marketing managers may be in charge of producing and delegating digital content production.

### Head Of Growth

B2B or technology-oriented companies frequently rely on a [Head Of Growth](https://draft.dev/learn/what-is-a-head-of-growth) to scale their brand’s presence and profit margins. This is a relatively new role in the industry and is particularly sought-after by brands like HubSpot, Uber, and EventBrite. There’s a good reason why: these experts track, report, and optimize key growth metrics across an entire organization – not just certain departments.

Most organizations expect three key functions from their head of growth: growth hacking, growth management, and growth nurturing. Other functions, including data analytics, are usually part of their daily responsibilities.

### Marketing Associate

Growing startups eventually begin the process of hiring marketing associates. Often referred to as MAs, these employees are responsible for creating and implementing all the elements of a marketing strategy – from content and reporting tasks to daily updates for supervisors.

The marketing associate may not sound like the flashiest of internal roles, but these employees are nothing less than essential. If you’re planning on growing your brand in any capacity, an MA will be one of your star players.

### Product Marketing Specialist

While marketing associates focus on brand-wide campaigns, a [Product Marketing Specialist](https://draft.dev/learn/what-is-a-product-marketing-specialist) is only interested in awareness, value, and demand for specific inventory. These relatively complex roles use a plethora of tools to effectively market their marketing projects and have an excellent understanding of data, KPIs, and additional growth metrics.

Product marketing specialists are one of the most complicated roles on this list. Project roles and duties vary widely from company to company, and will likely change over time as the job becomes more defined. If you’re interested in getting a job in the field, it would be wise to directly ask your employer about expected tasks and responsibilities.

### Advertising Specialist

It’s important to draw a clear distinction between the Marketing Specialist and the Advertising Specialist. While the marketer specifically focuses on customer support activities such as content production, UX, and social media, the advertiser is more interested in the promotion of a brand or idea. Advertising specialists create brand awareness campaigns, manage paid media activities, and otherwise monitor the growth of sponsorships and promotions.

Advertising specialists usually have the same organizational presence as marketing specialists, and may even be seated in the same department. This, like many things, is up to the discretion of the company.

### Developer Relations

One of the most exciting marketing roles in recent years includes [Developer Relations](https://draft.dev/learn/developer-relations-career-insights-from-7-industry-leaders). Think of it as a combination between PR reps and your software developers, with a sprinkle of speaking, writing, and conference paneling on the side.

Developer relations is becoming highly sought after in the marketing field, and has evolved into a critical role for startup tech companies. While job boundaries may be less defined, general responsibilities fall somewhere between marketing tasks, sales work, and elements of customer support. From creating technical content to running live demos and workshops, DevRels truly live in a class of their own.
