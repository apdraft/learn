Computer science is an amazing field of study, formalizing as a college discipline [in the ’60s](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Courses/134/history.html#:~:text=1960's,at%20Purdue%20University%20in%201962.) and evolving through the decades since to become part of daily life around the world. And, for some of us, it’s also turned into a passion.

Whether computer science is one of your college courses or just something of casual interest, this blog post is dedicated to you. Detailing 30 of the best computer science blogs, this list is a place to start; continue your own education and find enriching, intriguing topics related to this rapidly changing discipline, no matter your level of experience or your background. 

For easy skimming and quick decision-making, I’ve rated each blog based on five different criteria:

* **Writing quality:** the overall quality and readability of the content the blog normally produces.
* **Consistency:** how often the blog produces new content.
* **Longevity:** the length of time the blog has been around, which often indicates the trustworthiness and authority of its content.
* **Technical depth:** the level of technical detail you can expect to find on the blog.
* **Broad usefulness:** how many different interests, disciplines, and skill levels the blog appeals to.
