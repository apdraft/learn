I founded [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev) because I wanted to help create better content for software engineering blogs.

While the primary offering - **[technical content as a service](https://draft.dev)** - is a great option for funded startups that really want to invest in content marketing, it's not right for everyone. [Draft Academy](/learn/) offers resources for content managers who want to learn from the best practices we use to create content for our clients. 

### What's available here?
It all started with the [Technical Content Manager's Playbook](https://draft.dev/#playbook). I created this collection of resources to help new content managers kick-start their efforts when creating a blog. [You can download the playbook](https://draft.dev/#playbook) if you want to learn how to create briefs, a publishing calendar, and a style guide.

Beyond that, Iâ€™m starting to publish more about our processes at Draft.dev. For example, if you want to know how we hire technical writers, [you can find our hiring rubric here](https://draft.dev/learn/content-management/hiring-rubric). If you want to know how to promote your blog posts, you can get our [promotional checklist here](https://learn.draft.dev/posts/promotion).

In the coming months, we will be publishing blog posts, lessons, and free resources for technical bloggers and blog managers.

Thanks for reading!
