I founded [Draft](https://draft.dev) to help software engineering blogs create better content. While our primary offering - **technical blogging as a service** - is a great option for some companies, it's not right for everyone. [Draft Academy](/) offers resources for technical blogging managers who are either too small or too early for our content production services.

### What's available here?
It all started with the [Build a Better Blog Course](https://draft.dev/#course). This 7-day email course was created to help new blog managers kickstart their efforts when creating and committing to a blog. [Sign up](https://draft.dev/#course) if you want to learn how to recruit writers, promote your blog posts, write better content, and more. 

In the coming months, we will be publishing blog posts, lessons, and free resources for technical bloggers and blog managers.

Thanks for reading!
