If your product requires specialized knowledge or if you're trying to position yourself as a thought leader, creating an online course could be a great marketing strategy. Online courses can [even be businesses in their own right](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/make-money/how-to-create-online-courses/). Many people are more comfortable taking courses online so they don't have to leave home, but if you're trying to create one, where do you start?

## How to Create an Online Course
I worked in education technology for many years before I started [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev), so while I'm not an expert course creator, I have supported a number of others building online education solutions.

## Online Course Creation Platforms
This list is meant to provide a jumping-off point. I've tried to highlight many of the best course creation platforms available and give you a little bit of information about each one. Some are free and open-source, while others are paid and full of time-saving features.

While you'll still have to do the hard work of creating your online course, having the right course creation platform can make distribution and management much easier.
