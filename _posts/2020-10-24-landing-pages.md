One challenge that every startup faces is attracting and engaging users. Whether you sell a software tool or a service, you need a way to quickly tell visitors about it and hook them into trying it. That’s where a landing page comes in.

A good landing page helps visitors quickly determine whether or not your offering is right for them, and if it is, the landing page should direct them to take an action. Depending on what it is you’re promoting, your landing page might ask for an email address, encourage a file download, or direct users to add something to their cart.

Either way, you don’t have to spend weeks coding your landing page from scratch. In fact, even if you have developers on your team, I would encourage you to use a tool rather than try to build your own.

Fortunately, there are many great and easy-to-use landing page generators and tools available. Some require a little knowledge of HTML and CSS, while others are completely non-tech friendly. Try a few of these tools out, and let me know which one you prefer.

### Landing Page Tools

**[Carrd](https://carrd.co/)** ($9) - Simple to use and free to get started. This is my personal favorite for one-page landing pages.

**[ClickFunnels](https://www.clickfunnels.com/)** ($97) - Very linear landing page experience, but a bit pricey.

**[Elementor](https://elementor.com/)** ($0) - Specifically for Wordpress, Elementor gives you an interface for editing your site without code.

**[Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/04/07/gitlab-pages-setup/)** ($0) - If you prefer Gitlab to Github, this is a good option for landing page generation.

**[HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net/)** ($0) - Free HTML templates for landing pages.

**[Instapage](https://instapage.com/)** ($68) - While a bit pricey, I’ve enjoyed how much freedom Instapage gives you to customize your landing pages without writing HTML.

**[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** ($0) - If you don’t mind writing a little HTML yourself, Jekyll is an awesome landing page and blogging platform. It can scale pretty much infinitely and it’s free to use with Github pages.
