George Orwell once said, “When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, ‘I am going to produce a work of art.’ I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing.”

Orwell was a fictional author, but his sentiment applies to technical writing as well. Writing is not a series of words scattered chaotically until they make sense, but rather they are a series of words placed methodically so that one might portray a story or idea.

Write with a purpose and choose your words carefully. In the words of Hunter Thompson, “Not a wasted word. This has been a main point to my literary thinking all my life.”

Here are 32 tips for software engineers who want to become better writers:

### 1. Simplify the topic
Simplify rather than over-explaining the topics you're writing on. Give the reader a chance to think through what they are reading. Don’t talk down to readers.

### 2. Simplify your wording
Even if your reader understands technical jargon, most people do not want to read sentences that don't flow well or words that are hard to pronounce. A technical document should captivate and draw in a reader just like a story would.

### 3. Commit to a single topic
Draw in the reader and keep him or her away from outside distractions. Bunny-trailing and jumping between topics can be a big distraction to your reader. Jumping from one topic to another is okay sometimes, but too much jumping back and forth gets confusing for the reader.

### 4. Have a goal and drive it home
Be sure that your reader understands the main point. Repeat it often and state it clearly.

### 5. Know your audience
Know who your target audience is and who will be the most likely to read your work.

### 6. Distinguish between the beginning, the middle, and the end
Stick to your outline and ensure that you have smooth transitions between the various parts of your text.

### 7. Write for less-technical readers
Write so that it is easy for anyone, on any level, to understand.

### 8. Don’t repeat yourself 
Repeating the same thing over and over is not helpful. Find new ways to state or illustrate your main point.

### 9. Imagine explaining the topic out loud
How does your text sound when you read it aloud to another person? Good writing sounds natural and conversational.

### 10. Use real-world examples
Apply your writing to situations in the real world.

### 11. Use hypothetical but relevant examples
Use hypothetical scenarios to allow your readers to visualize your topic more clearly.

### 12. Build a foundation
Show your reader the big picture and then focus their attention on small details.

### 13. Make sure that your topic is relevant to someone
It's okay if your audience is tiny. Just make sure whatever you write is relevant to them.

### 14. Write to yourself
When you are writing, imagine how you would perceive it.

### 15. Write to your reader
Write to your reader as if you were having a one on one conversation with them, not as if you were giving a presentation.

### 16. Be consistent
Keep your writing style the same throughout the entire document.

### 17. Define a personality in your writing style
Find your own voice within your writing to make what you are saying more interesting.

### 18. Enjoy spreading your knowledge
Enjoy the fact that someone is coming to you for your advice and expertise. This happiness will be evident in your writing.

### 19. Know the content
Be knowledgeable of the material on which you are writing.

### 20. Establish a structure for your writing
Stick to your outline and allow the document to flow in a way that reads clearly and precisely.

### 21. Incorporate useful visuals
Pictures, tables, graphs, and code samples are great visual additions for your writing. Consider the visual aesthetic of your text, including how you organize your words, structure the document, and the font size you choose.

### 22. Keep a level head
Be passionate about what you are saying, but don’t overuse punctuation and excessive capitalization to get your point across.

### 23. Establish an appropriate voice
Allow your writing style to give you the voice that you need to adapt to particular instances.

### 24. Avoid time-sensitive claims
This is very important, especially in technical writing. Particular claims about facts may change depending on the circumstances, time period, and current supporting evidence.

### 25. Cite your sources
When you make a claim that isn't obvious, be sure to cite the source.

### 26. Revise
Craft the perfect final product by reviewing your draft and revising it as many times as you feel is necessary. Use tools like Grammarly to help catch small errors and get a proofreader for some of the bigger structural issues.

### 27. Check your facts
Back up your ideas by personally researching and checking your facts.

### 28. Explain new ideas clearly before presenting them
Before you dive headfirst into the most complicated parts of the topics, explain the subject matter so that your reader understands the context.

### 29. Reduce your use of ambiguous terms
When writing technical information, you must be clear and precise. Don’t let any of your words be open for interpretation.

### 30. Do not use isolating slang
Technical writing should generally be as polished and professional as possible. Some common jargon might be okay, but try to avoid culturally-specific slang.

### 31. Present yourself as a teacher
You are the teacher, and you are giving a presentation to your class. This is the approach you should take when writing technical information. Your work will be used for others to learn from your knowledge.

### 32. Present the material to the reader as if they were your student
If you are the teacher, then the reader is your student. Keep this idea in the back of your mind while you are writing. Write in a way that the reader wants to learn from you.

You won't become a great writer overnight. The craft of writing takes much practice to perfect. I hope that you found some of these tips useful in helping to make you a better writer. When it comes to writing, implement these skills to fit your unique style of communication. Remember, that even in technical writing, you want to capture your reader and draw them into your story.
