The world of tech and software development evolves fast, with new [frameworks and libraries](https://draft.dev/learn/technical-blogs/) advancing all the time. It’s important to stay tuned in, or you could be left behind. To make that less of a challenge, I’ve handpicked thirty engineering blogs that you should follow or at least bookmark for future reference.

_Engineering blog_ is, of course, an umbrella term that includes not just software engineering but also a wide range of engineering disciplines. So to properly evaluate each blog, I scored them against a consistent set of criteria: writing quality, consistency, longevity, technical depth, broad usefulness. 

Based on that criteria, here are the thirty best engineering blogs being published today:

### 1. [Facebook Engineering](https://engineering.fb.com/)

![Facebook](https://i.imgur.com/USAChud.png)

As one of the tech’s headliners, Facebook Engineering offers a highly technical digest on what’s going on in the software engineering world. From developer tools and popular platforms to infrastructure and artificial intelligence, the Facebook Engineering blog covers a wide range of topics and gives insights into how Facebook solves large-scale technical challenges. Also, if you’re looking for an open-source project to contribute to, you should definitely check out their [FioSynth](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/11/18/open-source/fiosynth/) project.

### 2. [Github Engineering](https://github.blog/category/engineering/)

GitHub is one of the most popular hosting sites for software development and version control using Git. Their blog has a special section for engineering posts, which I found really convenient. It covers mostly GitHub workflow topics and related issues, however, since GitHub is broadly implemented in many tech companies, it can be considered as a generally useful blog.

**Total score: 5.0**

### 3. [Heroku Engineering](https://blog.heroku.com/engineering)

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service where you can deploy projects and websites. It supports several programming languages, so it’s no surprise that Heroku’s really popular. Perhaps unexpectedly, the Heroku Engineering blog describes not only deployment issues but also a wide range of software-tangential topics. For example, I bookmarked this article for myself: [“Let's Debug a Node.js Application.”](https://blog.heroku.com/debug-node-applications)

### 4. [Amazon Web Services Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/)

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) blog is rather specific: it’s focused mostly on AWS implementation and related issues. However, AWS is one of the most common and broadly adopted cloud platforms in the world. As a result, the information provided by the articles can be applied to a range of industry workflows.

**Total score: 4.6**

### 5. [Microsoft Azure Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/)

Similar to AWS, Azure is a popular cloud provider. Its blog shares cloud-related information, particularly centered around Azure. However, since Azure is a common provider, this blog is still very useful, especially for those who are thinking of implementing it.

### 6. [Google Developers Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/)

Similar to Facebook Engineering, the Google Developers blog is a trustworthy digest of engineering news and mostly Google-related topics. Since Google is of an industry giant, the information you get will be highly applicable. Some might find it less technical than expected, but I enjoy the inspiring success stories and industry insights.

### 7. [Netflix Tech Blog](https://netflixtechblog.com/)

![Netflix](https://i.imgur.com/ptI9HgH.png)

Netflix is undoubtedly one of the most popular streaming services. A lot of different technical processes are going on under the hood: great UI and UX experience, a huge and uninterrupted movie database, and—the most exciting!—a machine-learning model that powers movie recommendations. From the Netflix Tech blog, you’ll learn about all these topics in-depth. It’s always helpful to know how a seamless client service experience was achieved, and this blog covers that.

### 9. [Spotify Engineering](https://engineering.atspotify.com/)

The Spotify blog is one of my personal favorites; I enjoy the engaging and easy writing style as well as the range of topics. Most of them are related to Spotify and all the magic behind one of the most popular music apps. But still, it covers a lot of general cloud, API, and machine-learning subjects, and videos and podcasts break up the more standard blog posts.

Dev.to is a tech blogging platform for creating blogs and sharing knowledge about various technical topics. A lot of articles are written by students and engineers young in their careers, but I find the experiences they share rather valuable. The content here might not always be deep, but the platform is priceless for anyone looking for a personal approach and real-life stories. Also, Dev.to’s tagging system and sorting options are rather convenient.
