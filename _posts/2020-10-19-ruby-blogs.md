[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a popular language used for building full-stack and backend web applications, so I set out to find the 22 best Ruby blogs publishing today. Developers who want to keep up with Ruby’s new features, frameworks, and best practices should keep up with the content they find most helpful.

To build this list, I researched, analyzed, and read articles by several authors on each blog to get an idea of their standards, composition, insight, simplicity, and eloquence. I also looked at feedback from developers to figure out which blogs are the most useful to the community. 

Here are the top 22 Ruby blogs and resources I found:

### 1. [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/) 

![Ruby Weekly Newsletter](https://i.imgur.com/JJqJDNn.png)

Ruby Weekly is a newsletter that features the latest news and trends on Ruby. Ruby Weekly is very comprehensible and has excellent feedback from the developer community. On the home page, there is a preview of the latest issue to enable you to get an overview of the content. A new issue is published weekly and includes several well-written and well-referenced articles.
