Newsletters are one of the most [effective ways to reach an audience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/targeted-email-newsletters/), even with the proliferation of various forms of media.

In developer marketing, newsletters play a unique part in your arsenal of marketing tools. Software development is constantly evolving. Breaking changes, new tools, and updated best practices are added every day, so keeping up can be incredibly hard.

Curated newsletters help developers keep up because a set of experts have already sorted through the content and picked the best stuff. Developers don't have to worry about being overrun with information while keeping tabs on everything that’s changing.

In addition, newsletters are typically trusted by readers who opt in to receive them. The fact that they provided their email signals interest, engagement, and trust. Within the developer community - a segment that’s known for its skepticism of hardcore advertisements - having that trust factor can make a big difference in reaching leads.

So in this piece, I wanted to offer a collection of a wide variety of developer-focused newsletters. I’ve included each newsletter’s category, sponsorship rates, and contact information in case you want to pitch them stories or sponsor them.

As we find new newsletters, this list will continue to grow, so check back periodically or [email us](mailto:info@draft.dev) if you know of another newsletter we should include.

You can view all the [newsletters in this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q8uuGIerBCThDzzaQFl01aZStEBkgE4Qa_VAyIyAVdk/edit#gid=0) or read a short summary of each newsletter below.
