Newsletters continue to be one of the most effective means of connecting with an audience, even amidst the plethora of media formats available today.

In [developer marketing](https://draft.dev/learn/developer-marketing), newsletters play a unique part in your arsenal of [marketing tools](https://draft.dev/learn/tools). Software development is constantly evolving. Breaking changes, new tools, and updated best practices are added every day, so keeping up in the tech industry can be incredibly hard.

Curated newsletters help developers keep up because a set of experts have already sorted through the content and picked the best stuff. Developers don’t have to worry about being overrun with information while keeping tabs on everything that’s changing in the tech industry.

Unlike traditional advertising, developer newsletters are typically trusted sources of information, as readers actively opt in to receive them. This willingness to provide their email addresses signals their interest, engagement, and trust. In a community known for its skepticism of hard-sell tactics, this trust factor can make a world of difference in generating leads.

So, in this piece, I wanted to compile a roundup of a diverse selection of developer newsletters, spanning from tech leadership and web development to specific coding languages. I’ve included each newsletter’s category, sponsorship rates, and contact information in case you want to pitch them stories or sponsor them.

As we find new developer newsletters, this list will continue to grow, so check back periodically or email us if you know of another one we should include.
