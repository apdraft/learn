    <p>At <a href="https://draft.dev">Draft.dev</a>, we help our clients create great technical blogs. Along the way, we have run across a lot of great resources that inspire and guide us.</p>

    <p>So, we wanted to build this collection of the most popular tech blogs  to help our clients and readers find other great resources. Each post has been written by a subject matter expert who knows the topic. They've ranked 20-50 of the best developer blogs in their area of expertise based on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Writing Quality</strong> - Not all writing is created equal. While a technical blog might have a little more leeway than a novel, the author's writing must pass a certain bar to make sure their points can be understood.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency</strong> - One of the most important factors in a blog's success in publishing consistently. Often, this is what separates an average from an excellent blog.</li>
        <li><strong>Longevity</strong> - Blogs that have survived the ups and downs of the internet for years tend to have something special. While not an indicator of a good blog on its own, longevity is part of what points to success.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Depth</strong> - Lots of programmers cover entry-level topics on their blogs, but deep, unique technical knowledge is rare.</li>
        <li><strong>Broad Usefulness</strong> - While each of these blogs covers a niche, blogs that are too narrowly focused are less useful to readers.</li>
    </ul>
